# Airedale and Wharfedale Lines (Shipley Triangle)

Shipley station is one of only two remaining triangle stations in the UK. Situated on the junction of the busy Airedale and Wharfedale commuter lines, east of Leeds, the station has 5 platforms to serve all three directions.

Included are the Wharfedale Line to Ilkley, the Airedale Line to Skipton, and the branch from Shipley to Bradford Forster Square. These lines are operated by Northern, with an intensive local commuter service all day using electric class 333 multiple units. Additionally, LNER provide some long distance services in the peaks between London King's Cross and Skipton / Bradford Forster Square.

## Simulation

A timetable for a weekday in September 2023 is included, with all passenger and ECS moves simulated. Freight has been omitted for ease of operation.

The following services operate:

- 2tph Leeds to Ilkley (NT)
- 2tph Leeds to Bradford Forster Square (NT)
- 2tph Leeds to Skipton (NT)
- 1tph Bradford Forster Square to Ilkley (NT)
- 1tph Bradford Forster Square to Skipton (NT)
- 1tph Leeds to Morecambe/Carlisle (alternating) (NT)

During peak hours, the Bradford Forster Square to Ilkley and Skipton services both increase to 2tph, and additional express services are provided by LNER.

In the evening, the Leeds to Bradford Forster Square service is replaced with a shuttle between Bradford Forster Square and Shipley.

## Operational Tips

- Check for platform allocations at Ilkley, Shipley, Bradford Forster Square and Skipton. Sometimes trains may need to be called into already occupied platforms, and this may require the train already there to be taken under signaller control.
- LNER services to Bradford Forster Square should use Shipley P3 in passenger service - platform 4 isn't long enough for these trains.
- Don't set routes too early, as trains may suddenly appear and require the junction first.
- Keep an eye on timings - especially at Skipton trains can arrive very early. Don't be afraid to hold them outside the station for a bit until a train has departed.
